# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Machine-Learning-A-Random-Forest-Approach
OVERVIEW:
This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model built with the Random Forest algorithm. The project leverages a dataset containing various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more, to create an accurate and robust model for price prediction.

DATASET:
The dataset used in this project includes information about various houses, such as:
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage of the living area and lot
- Year built and renovated
- Location details (latitude, longitude)
- Grade of the house (quality)
- Condition of the house (good, bad, etc.)
- and more...

MODELING APPROACH:
1. Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned by handling missing values and feature engineering was performed, such as extracting the year and month from the date.
2. Feature Scaling: Features were scaled using 'StandardScaler' to standardize the data.
3. Model Selection: A Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets with high-dimensional features and interactions.
4. Training and Testing: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

EVALUATION METRICS:
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R^2 Score

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
Feature importance was analyzed using two methods:
1. Built-in Feature Importance: Provided by the Random Forest model to identify which features contribute the most to the predictions.
2. Permutation Feature Importance: Evaluated how much the model's accuracy decreased when each feature's values were randomly shuffled, providing another perspective on feature importance.
